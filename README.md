# Spellchecker

## Description
Last year, i've done a class project in duo to create a spellchecker from scratch, we of course had some ressources to check out on how to realize this, anyway, we built this from scratch and since i'm pretty proud even though it's horribly optimized, I'm posting it, I learned during this project the importance of "complexity" and using the right data structure.

To use it, run it and write a word mispelled, the program will then looking for the 5 most likely words that you might've looked for.

Since everything is in french, writing in english will probably not be effective since all the words are taken from the french dictionnary, it might work to replace it by the english version.
